    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This cheeseburger soup made with lean ground beef and veggies in a creamy broth is rich, tasty, and filling. I use sharp Cheddar cheese because I like the taste but any Cheddar is good.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>½ pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>¾ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>¾ cup shredded carrots</li>
        <li>¾ cup chopped celery</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
        <li>4 cups cubed potatoes</li>
        <li>3 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups milk</li>
        <li>2 cups cubed Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup sour cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large pot over medium heat; add ground beef, onion, carrots, and celery. Cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in basil and parsley. Add potatoes and broth and bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer until potatoes are tender, 10 to12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Melt remaining 3 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and whisk until smooth, about 1 minute. Gradually whisk in milk; simmer and stir until sauce is thick and smooth.</li>
        <li>Stir sauce into soup, stirring constantly. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and stir in cheese until melted. Add sour cream; stir until just heated through.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
